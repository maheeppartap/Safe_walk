You can run the project just like you build a regular gradle project. You will need android studio
along with Java 11.
The tests were run using a Pixel XL, running API 30 android 11. You can use the AVD manager to
emulate the device. Note that you will need to enable the google play services to use the map
feature.
In android studio, press ctrl+alt+s, and navigate to appearance&behaviour -> system settings ->
SDK tools and enable google play services. Also enable everything that has "google play" in it's
name because things break and we don't know why.
Please use Android studio to run this. You will not have a good time if you build it manually.
